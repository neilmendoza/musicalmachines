# Musical Machines and Flapping Phones

This is the code for the talk I gave at FITC entitled [Musical Machines and Flapping Phones](http://www.slideshare.net/neilmendoza/musical-machines-and-flapping-phones)


* **openFrameworksWaveform** - OF app demonstrating what a square wave sounds and looks like with rainbow bread dogs.
* **arduinoSimpleMidi** - Arduino sketch showing how to read MIDI.
* **arduinoMidiToFrequency** - Arduino sketch showing how to read MIDI and convert it to a frequency to control a stepper.
* **arduinoOscillator** - More advanced Arduino sketch showing how to read MIDI and control multiple stepper motors, car dooe locks at the same time.
* **arduinoMakeCall** - Arduino sketch showing how to make a call using serial.
* **arduinoReceiveCall** - Arduino sketch showing how to receive a call using serial.

The Arduino code can be run from anywhere.  If you want to run **openFrameworksWaveform**, you will need to clone the repository into **/path/to/openFrameworks/apps/**.
